# TestDrive

**Docker Swarm**

The deployment guide for Docker Swarm contains a simple one-line command to get you up and running in around 60 seconds. It also includes a set of [sample functions](https://github.com/openfaas/faas/tree/master/sample-functions) which you can use with the TestDrive instructions below.

**Kubernetes**

OpenFaaS is Kubernetes-native - you can follow the [deployment guide here](https://github.com/openfaas/faas/blob/master/guide/deployment_k8s.md).

The new login feature breaks the one-click deployment to PWD.

The TestDrive gets you up and running with OpenFaaS within a few minutes.
